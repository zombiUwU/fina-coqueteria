""Sapphire was the first song I finished for Play that made me know where the album was heading. It's why I finished the recording process in Goa surrounded by some of the best musicians in India. It was an incredible creative process. I shot the music video with Liam Pethick and Nic Minns across my India tour earlier this year, we wanted to showcase the beauty and breadth of the country and its culture. The final jigsaw piece for me was getting @Official_ArijitSingh on the record, but it was a journey to get there and such an amazing day of music and family. Me and him have done a full Punjabi version of the song that will come out in the next few weeks, which has a lot more of him on it. This is the album version of the song, and my favourite song on the album. Hope you guys love it. Sapphire out now"" - Ed x

Lyrics

You’re glowing
You colour and fracture the light
You can’t help but shine
And I know that
You carry the world on your back
But look at you tonight
The lights

Your face
Your eyes
Exploding
Like fireworks
In the sky
Sapphire
Touching on your body while you’re pushing on me
Don’t you end the party
I could do this all week
We’ll be dancing till the morning
Go to bed we won’t sleep
Cham cham chamke sitare wargi
Sapphire
Touching on your body while you’re pushing on me
Don’t you end the party
I could do this all week
We’ll be dancing till the morning
Go to bed we won’t sleep
Cham cham chamke sitare wargi
Look what we found
Karma reached out
Into our hearts and pulled us to our feet now
You know the truth is
We could disappear
Anywhere as long as I got you there
When the sun dies
Till the day shines
When I’m with you
There’s not enough time
You are my spring flower
Watching you bloom, wow
We’re are surrounded but I can only see
The lights
Your face
Your eyes
Exploding
Like fireworks
In the sky

Sapphire
Touching on your body while you’re pushing on me
Don’t you end the party
I could do this all week
We’ll be dancing till the morning
Go to bed we won’t sleep
Cham cham chamke sitare wargi
Sapphire
Touching on your body while you’re pushing on me
Don’t you end the party
I could do this all week
We’ll be dancing till the morning

Sapphire
You’re glowing
You’re glowing
You colour and fracture the light
Look at you
Tonight

Lyrics
Your morning eyes, I could stare like watching stars
I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought
You'd be mine, would you mind if I took your hand tonight?
Know you're all that I want this life

I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The ocean's colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me?

My love will always stay by you
I'll keep it safe, so don't you worry a thing, I'll tell you I love you more
It's stuck with you forever, so promise you won't let it go
I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you

I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The ocean's colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you

Lyrics:
VERSE 1
They say the holy waters watered down and this town's lost it faith
Our colors will fade Eventually
So if our time is running out day after day we’ll make the mundane our masterpiece

PRE
Oh my my Oh my my
Love I take one look at you

CHORUS
Taking me out of
Of the ordinary I want you laying me down
Til we’re dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine the
Angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found something so out of the ordinary you got
me kissing the ground of your sanctuary shatter me with your touch
Oh lord return me to dust the
Angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found

VERSE 2
Hopeless hallelujah
Oh this side of heaven’s gates
On my life
How do ya Breathe and Take my breath away
At your alter I will pray
You’re the sculptor I’m the clay
Oh my my

CHORUS
You’re taking me out
Of the ordinary I want you laying me down
Til we’re dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine
The Angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found something so out of the ordinary you got me kissing the ground
of your sanctuary shatter me with your touch
Oh lord return me to dust
The Angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found
BRIDGE
Something so heavenly
Higher than ecstasy whenever your next to me
Oh my my world was in black and white until I saw your light)
I thought you had to die to find something so out

CHORUS
Of the ordinary I want you laying me down
Til we’re dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine
The Angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found something so out of the ordinary you got me kissing the ground
of your sanctuary shatter me with your touch
Oh lord return me to dust
The Angels up in the clouds Are jealous knowing we found

[Verse 1]
My baby want a Birkin
, she's been tellin' me all night long
Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on
This 9 to 5 ain't workin', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone (Uh)


[Pre-Chorus]
One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round"", we need plenty more
Two steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord




[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history
Therе's a party downtown, near 5th Street
Everybody at the bar gеttin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy


[Verse 2]
I've been Boozey since I left, I ain't changin' for a check
Tell my ma', I ain't forget (Oh, Lord, uh)


Woke up drunk at 10 a.m., we gon' do this shit again
Tell your girl to bring a friend (Oh, Lord)


[Pre-Chorus]
One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round"", we need plenty more
Two steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord


[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (A double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (We go way back)


There's a party downtown, near 5th Street
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (Woo)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (At the bar gettin' tipsy)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy


[Bridge]
One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four
When it's last call and they kick us out the door
It's gettin' kind of late but the ladies want some more
Oh my, good Lord (Tell 'em drinks on me)


[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (A double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (Way back)
There's a party downtown, near 5th Street (Come on)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (Woo-ooh)
Can someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (A double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (It's Jack D)
At the bottom of a bottle gon' miss me (Baby, don't miss me)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (At the bar gettin' tipsy)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

[Outro]
That's fuckin' messed up, bro, they kicked me out the bar

Lyrics:
You know I'm impatient
So why would you leave me waiting outside the station?
When it was like minus 4 degrees 
And I get what you're saying
I just really don't want to hear it right now
Can you shut up for like once in your life?
Listen to me
I took your nice words of advice about
How you think I'm gonna die
Lucky if I turned 33
Okay, so yeah, I smoke like a chimney
I'm not skinny and I pull a Britney
Every other week
But cut me some slack
Who do you want me to be?

'Cause I'm too messy
And then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, ""Get a job""
And you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect
'Til I open my big mouth
I want to be me
Is that not allowed?
And I'm too clever
And then I'm too fucking dumb
You hate it when I cry
Unless it's that time of the month
And I'm too perfect
'Til I show you that I'm not
A thousand people I could be for you
And you hate the fucking lot

You hate the fucking lot
You hate the fucking lot

It's taking you ages
You still don't get the hint
I'm not asking for pages
But one text or two would be nice
And please, don't pull those faces
When I've been out working my arse off all day
It's just one bottle of wine or two
But hey, you can't even talk
You smoke weed just to help you sleep
Then why you're out getting stoned at 4 o'clock
And then you come home to me
And don't say hello
'Cause I got high again
And forgot to fold my clothes

'Cause I'm too messy
And then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, ""Get a job""
And you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect
'Til I open my big mouth
I want to be me
Is that not allowed?
And I'm too clever
And then I'm too fucking dumb
You hate it when I cry
Unless it's that time of the month
And I'm too perfect
'Til I show you that I'm not
A thousand people I could be for you
And you hate the fucking lot
You hate the fucking lot
You hate the fucking lot

And I'm too messy
And then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, ""Get a job""
And you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect
'Til I open my big mouth
I want to be me
Is that not allowed?
And I'm too clever
And then I'm too fucking dumb
You hate it when I cry
Unless it's that time of the month
And I'm too perfect
'Til I show you that I'm not

LYRICS:
Sun is going down, time is running out
No one else around but me
Steady losing light
Steady losing my mind
Moving shadows and grinding teeth

Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight
What I’d do for a little bit of peace and quiet
Without you I keep

Slippin into bad dreams
Where there’s no you and I
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these bad dreams
Waiting on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free from all of these, all of these
(ooh) Bad dreams
(ooh) All of these, baby, please

Come around
Help me settle down
Hellish habits can cloud my head
What you waiting for
Something physical
I can’t do this by myself

Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight
What I’d do for a little bit of peace and quiet
Without you I keep

Slippin into bad dreams
Where there’s no you and I
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these (all of these) bad dreams
Waiting on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free (set me free) from all of these, all of these
(ooh) Bad dreams, baby, please
(ooh) All of these (baby, please) all of these

I ain’t never rep a set baby
I ain’t do no wrong
I could clean up good for you
Oh I know right from wrong
Cause I wanna make it (so badly)
I’m a Million Dollar Baby (don’t at me)
Hell no

You rep my city for so damn long
But you still don’t notice me
My sound next
VA next
I’m at they neck
I’m running up a check
She a bad lil mama she a diva
No matter what happens he cannot come between us again
I know we’re better than friends (better than friends)
I took her to Queen’s Gambit, showed around my friends
Tried to pick some energy up it don’t better
I know you haven’t moved on, if you tried
I don’t believe it baby, I know you lied
All night long
What you mean I changed
Haven't stayed the same
I’ve been losing my mind
I said the city is mine

I ain’t never rep a set baby
Ain’t do no wrong
I could clean up, do it for you
Oh I know right from wrong

LYRICS:
 
You said your phone was broken
Just forgot to charge it
Whole outfit you’re wearing
God I hope it’s ironic
Did you just say you’re finished?
Didn’t know we started
It’s all just so familiar
Baby, what do you call it?
Stupid
Or is it
Slow?
Maybe it’s
Useless?
But there’s a cuter word for it
I know
Manchild
Why you always come a running to me?
Fuck my life
Won’t you let an innocent woman be?
Never heard of self care
Half your brain just aint there
Manchild
Why you always come a running
Taking all my loving from me?
Why so sexy
If so dumb?
And how survive the earth so long?
If I’m not there it won’t get done
I choose to blame your mom
Manchild
Why you always come a running to me?
Fuck my life
Won’t you let an innocent woman be?
Never heard of self care
Half your brain just aint there
Manchild
Why you always come a running
Taking all my loving from me?
Oh I like my boys playing hard to get
And I like my men all incompetent
And I swear they choose me
I’m not choosing them
Amen
Hey men!
Oh, I like my boys playing hard to get
And I like my men all incompetent
And I swear they choose me
I’m not choosing them
Amen
(Amen)
Hey men!
(Hey men!)
Manchild
Why you always come a running to me?
(always come a running to me)
Fuck my life
Won’t you let an innocent woman be?
Oh, I like my boys playing hard to get
And I like my men all incompetent
And I swear they choose me
I’m not choosing them
Amen
Hey men!

LYRICS:

Oh I leave quite an impression 
Five feet to be exact
You’re wondering why half his clothes went missing 
My bodies where they’re at 
Now I’m gone but you’re still layin’ 
Next to me 
One degree of separation
 
(I) Heard you’re back together and if that’s true 
You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissing you
If you want forever and I bet you do 
Just know you’ll 
Taste me 
Too 

Uh huh
 
He pins you down on the carpet
Makes paintings with his tongue
(La la la la la la la)
He’s funny now all his jokes hit different 
Guess who he learned that from 
 
Now I’m gone but you’re still layin’
Next to me 
One degree of separation 
 
(I) Heard you’re back together and if that’s true 
You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissing you
If you want forever and I bet you do 
Just know you’ll 
Taste me 
Too 
 
(La la la la la la la)

Every time you close your eyes 
And feel his lips you’re feelin’ mine 
And every time you breathe his air 
Just know I was already there 
You can have him if you like 
I’ve been there done that once or twice 
And singin’ ‘bout it don’t mean I care 
Yeah I know I’ve been known to share 
 
Well I heard you’re back together and if that’s true 
You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissing you
If you want forever and I bet you do 
Just know you’ll 
Taste me 
Too 

Taste me too 
(La la la la la la la)
You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissing you
You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissing you

Pabllo Vittar
No meu amor sempre tem dor
Tudo pelo meu prazer

Sevdaliza
Can you remember when the last time was 
You felt safe 
In the dark
This world was never meant 
For a woman’s heart 
Still you rise 
Through it all 

When I’m out of breath she’s my vitals 
When I need to rev she’s my ride or die 
When I’m out of faith she’s my idol 
I just killed a man she’s my alibi 

Rosa, que linda eres (Alibi)
Rosa, que linda eres tu (Alibi)
Rosa, que linda eres (Alibi)
Rosa, que linda eres 

Yseult
Tout est nasty,
Que des mélo mélo dans ma tête
Que des mélo mélo dans ma tête
Que des mélo mélo dans ma tête

My baby doo doo 
Bisou dans le cou 
Sur mon corps tu donneras tout tout
Do u want it, do u want it too, 

Ton corps sera mon été 
Mmmm
J’ai mis ton coeur de côté 

Fini le temps des poètes,
Je les hais comme je les aime,
Quand je tue un homme, elle est mon alibi 

Rosa, que linda eres (Alibi)
Rosa, que linda eres tu (Alibi)
Rosa, que linda eres (Alibi)
Rosa, que linda eres

Pabllo Vittar
Muito prazer em conhecer
O causador de todo o teu sofrer
E eu vim de longe só pra te dizer
Tu é o meu mal querer

No meu amor sempre tem dor
Ela é meu álibi

Rosa, que linda eres (Alibi)
Rosa, que linda eres tu (Alibi)

Lyrics:
 
Time stood still
Just like a photograph
You made me feel
Like this would last forever
Looking in your eyes
I see my whole life

Ooh
They say you know it when you know it
And I know
Ooh
Promise that you’ll hold me close don’t let me go
Hey!

Take my heart don’t break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along
You and I stargazing
Intertwining souls
We were never strangers
You were right there all along

I lose my mind
When I’m around you how I come alive
When I’m without you
I can’t help but feel so lost
I wanna give you all I’ve got

Ooh
They say you know it when you know it
And I know
Ooh
Promise that you’ll hold me close don’t let me go
Hey!

Take my heart don’t break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along
You and I stargazing
Intertwining souls
We were never strangers
You were right there all along

Take my heart don’t break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along

Lyrics:
Tell me that I’m special 
Tell me I look pretty 
Tell me I'm a little angel 
Sweetheart of your city 
Say what I'm dying to hear 
Cause I'm dying to hear you 

Tell me I'm that new thing 
Tell me that I'm relevant 
Tell me that I got a big heart 
Then back it up with evidence 
I need it and I don’t know why 
This late at night 

Isn’t it lonely 
I'd do anything to make you want me 
I'd give it all up if you told me 
That I'd be 
The number one girl in your eyes 
Your one and only 
So what’s it gon’ take for you to want me 
I’d give it all up if you told me 
That I’d be 
The number one girl in your eyes 

Tell me I’m going real big places
Down to earth so friendly 
And even through all the phases 
Tell me you accept me 
Well that’s all I'm dying to hear 
Yeah I'm dying to hear you 

Tell me that you need me 
Tell me that I’m loved 
Tell me that I’m worth it 
And that I’m enough 
I need it and I don’t know why 
This late at night 

Isn’t it lonely 
I'd do anything to make you want me 
I'd give it all up if you told me
That I'd be 
The number one girl in your eyes 
Your one and only 
So what’s it gon’ take for you to want me 
I’d give it all up if you told me 
That I’d be 
The number one girl in your eyes 

The girl in your eyes 
The girl in your eyes 
Tell me I’m the number one girl 
I'm the number one girl in your eyes 
The girl in your eyes 
The girl in your eyes 
Tell me I'm the number one girl 
I'm the number one girl in your eyes 

Well isn't it lonely 
I'd do anything to make you want me
 I'd give it all up if you told me 
That I'd be 
The number one girl in your eyes 

Your one and only 
So what’s it ‘gon take for you to want me 
I’d give it all up if you told me 
That I’d be

“Sally, When The Wine Runs Out” Lyrics: 
Well, I met Sally at a late night dive bar
She don't dance but she downs her drinks
Heard through a friend she's a born again wild card
She was telling me wild things
She was telling me wild things
Lives down the street past the 7-Eleven 
Just close enough that I spent the night
She grabbed my hand at the intersection
I spilled my guys at the red light
 
Sally
That feeling’s coming around
Please don't go falling in love
Then disappear when the wine runs out
Sally
I'll buy a couple of rounds
Don't let me think I’m enough
Then disappear when the wine runs out
 
I open up while she's flipping through pages
Getting lonely as the days get dark
If you’re bored and your mind starts changing
Maybe just give me a head start
And I, I see the glass in your eyes
Just trying to keep it alive, for crying out loud
 
Sally
That feeling’s coming around
Please don't go falling in love
Then disappear when the wine runs out
Sally
I'll buy a couple of rounds
Don't let me think I’m enough
Then disappear when the wine runs out
 
Oh shit here we go again
I'm falling headfirst
Ankles hit the two step
Sally makes my head hurt
Heard through the grapevine
She can be diva
Cold like Minnesota
Hotter than a fever
Oh shit here we go again
I'm falling headfirst
Ankles hit the two step
Sally makes my head hurt
Heard through the grapevine
She can be diva
Cold like Minnesota
Hotter than a fever
 
Sally
That feeling’s coming around
Please don't go falling in love
Then disappear when the wine runs out
Sally
I'll buy a couple of rounds
Don't let me think I’m enough
Then disappear when the wine runs out

Lyrics: 
Call us what we are
Toxic from the start
Can’t pretend that I was in the dark 
When you met my friends
Didn’t even try with them
I should’ve known it then that you were

Jealous and possessive 
So manipulating 
Honestly impressive
You had me participating

Back then
When I was running out of your place I said
I never wanna see your face
And then
I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end

Uh huh
Cuz even when I said it was over
You heard Baby can you pull me in closer You were
Plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end

Ladies & Gentleman
I present to you, the ex

His favorite game is chess
Who would ever guess
Playing with the pieces in my chest 
Now he’s on the screen
Saying don’t leave
You stole that line from me
Cuz you’re just

Jealous and possessive
 So manipulating 
Honestly impressive
You had me participating
Back then
When I was running out of your place I said
I never wanna see your face
I meant
I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end

Uh huh
Cuz even when I said it was over
You heard Baby can you pull me in closer 
You were
Plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end

End end

I can forgive you for a lot of things
For not giving me back my Tiffany rings 
I’ll never forgive you for one thing my dear
You wasted my prettiest years
Back then
When I was running out of your place I said
I never wanna see your face
I meant
I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic

Uh huh
Cuz even when I said it was over
You heard Baby can you pull me in closer You were
Plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end

End end
We were toxic till the end 
End end

LYRICS
 
It’s fine, it's cool
You can say that we are nothing but you know the truth
And guess i'm the fool
With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof

I don't wanna call it off
But you don't wanna call it love
You just wanna love someone who calls you baby

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse another stupid reason
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

I’m cliche 
Who cares 
It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair
And i cry, it's not fair
I just need a little lovin’  i just need a little air 

Think im gonna call it off
Even if you call it love
I just wanna love someone who calls me baby

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse another stupid reason
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

And when you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
With your head in your hands you’re nothing more than his wife 
And when you think about me all of those years ago
You're standing face to face with """"i told you so""""
You know I hate to say , i told you so
You know i hate to say it but, i told you so
Well i told you so 

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse another stupid reason
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

Lyrics:
[LISA]
Here I go
Banging it banging it wanna crack these walls
Banging it banging it wanna echo through the halls
Pulling up fresh face brand new día
Uh Lalisa & Rosalia

Soak up, all new
So I cut
I go go to the root
Off to bloom yeah
Purple into gold
Pain has come and gone again
Walked through that fire rediscover ah ah

Hit it when I serve
Bitch you better swerve
Revving up my au au au aura
Focus on my mind
Taking my-y time
I’m a new woman 
Woman
Bitch you better swerve
Revving up my au au au aura
Focus on my mind
Taking my-y time
I’m a new woman
Woman
Face eyes body go wild
You want this? I’m a new woman, woman
Eyes, I’m all about mind 
You want this?
I’m a new woman, woman

[ROSALÍA]
Por todo lo que soy
yo puedo frontear
no por lo que tenga
siempre me la dan
Y mi energía
inmaculada
bajo perfily tu estás fuera

Vivo pa cantar 
no canto pa vivir
nací pura así
Ni una era será un flop
en mi porvenirputa soy la Rosalía
solo sé server
La noche estrellada
Así seaHasta la madrugada
que así sea

Purple into gold
Pain has come and gone again
Walked through that fireI rediscover ah ah

Yo le meto duro
Sale bien seguro
Acelero mi aura
Yo estoy enfocada
No presiona nada
I'm a new woman woman
Sale bien seguro
Acelero mi aura
Yo estoy enfocada
No presiona nada
I'm a new woman woman

[LISA]
Face eyes body go wild
You want this? I’m a new woman, woman
Eyes, I’m all about mind
You want this?

Gimme that gimme that
Alpha yuh
Gimme that bigger the better urgh
Feeding you the bloom growing out ma sleeve
Kissed from a rose baby what a what a meal

Bad luck a sucker
Gotta make you tougher
Tryna say you suffer
Oh don’t blame your mother
Elevate I liberate a new frontier
I’m a new woman

Azizam Lyrics:

Azizam
Meet me on the floor tonight
Show me how to move like the water
In between the dancing lights
Be mine be mine
Azizam

I wanna be nowhere but here with you now
I wanna be one in this space
I wanna be tangled and wrapped in your cloud
I wanna be close to your face

Well tomorrow can wait
Losing time in this place
Till the sun is awake
Be like a magnet on me

I don’t care what they say
We can do it our way
And if love’s just a game
Then come and play

Azizam
Meet me on the floor tonight
Show me how to move like the water
In between the dancing lights
Be mine be mine
Azizam

Azizam
Azizam

I wanna get lost in your ocean and drown
I wanna be careless and free
I wanna live here in the moment we found
I wanna be all that you see

Well tomorrow can wait
Losing time in this place
Till the sun is awake
Be like a magnet on me

I don’t care what they say
We can do it our way
And if love’s just a game
Then come and play

Azizam
Meet me on the floor tonight
Show me how to move like the water
In between the dancing lights
Be mine be mine
Azizam

Meet me on the floor tonight
Show me how to move like the water
In between the dancing lights
Be mine be mine

Lyrics:
Touch my body tender
'Cause the feeling makes me weak
Kicking off the covers
I see the ceiling while you're looking down at me

How can we go back to being friends
When we just shared a bed?
How can you look at me and pretend
I'm someone you've never met?

It was last December
You were layin' on my chest
I still remember
I was scared to take a breath, didn't want you to move your head

How can we go back to being friends
When we just shared a bed? (Yeah)
How can you look at me and pretend
I'm someone you've never met?

The devil in your eyes
Won't deny the lies
You've sold, I'm holding on too tight
While you let go, this is casual

How can we go back to being friends
When we just shared a bed? (Yeah)
How can you look at me and pretend
I'm someone you've never met?

How can we go back to being friends
When we just shared a bed? (Yeah)
How can you look at me and pretend
I'm someone you've never met?
I'm someone you've never met (yeah)

Lyrics:
Let’s make tonight the weekend
I don’t wanna wait - I don’t wanna wait - I don’t wanna wait
Got no reason not to celebrate
Baby I just don’t wanna wait

Swimming in the deep blue
Got me thinking bout you
I’m just tryna dive right in
Wanna spend tonight like
The last night of our lives
Chasing all the love we can

And now oh I’m in a sea of lights
And all that I can see is you
And now I’m dying to feel alive
So baby let’s try something new

Let’s make tonight the weekend
I don’t wanna wait - I don’t wanna wait - I don’t wanna wait
Got no reason not to celebrate
Baby I just don’t wanna wait

I been chasing so long
Every right that feels wrong
Rather be with you instead
There’s something bout it right here
Got me seeing so clear
Rainbow colored skies ahead

Lyrics:
I’d never met you but I wanted
To invite you to the party
Then you walked in
With those green eyes never stolen by nobody

And they flicker to the future
For a moment I could picture
Then you touch me
And I come back and we’re talking on the staircase

Bout your big dreams, on the big screen
Out of Georgia now you’re lonely in this city
Lying with me
And you’re scared it’s moving quickly

Now you’re crying
You’re in pieces
Cause the only love you’ve ever known is Jesus
I can feel it
And I hate that I’m the reason that you’re
You’re in your head right now
While your whole world is spinning out

So slow it down
Take a moment now
We’re too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubts
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
let me help you slow it down

Ain’t it funny, how it changes
How a future rearranges
I get nervous, oh I’m anxious
Maybe loving you is dangerous
I could lose you like the others
Only girl that’s never left me is my mother
Oh I love her
And I know you probably hate it

But I’m in my head my head right now

So slow it down
Take a moment now
We’re too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubts
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
let me…

Slow it
Slow it down
When you’re on the ground
And you’re crying
I’m just trying
To slow it down
When you’re spinning round
In your head

I’ll help you slow it down

Lyrics:
Oh I hope you know I will carry you home
Whether it’s tonight or 55 years down the road
Oh I know there’s so many ways that this could go
Don’t want you to wonder darling I need you to know
 
We were talking to the sunset
Throwing dreams against the wall
I know none of them have stuck yet
But I bet it on you honey oh I would risk it all
 
These days, these nights, are changing
Mama, my mind, is set on you
I'm not afraid to say it, to say it’s true
 
Oh I hope you know I will carry you home
Whether it’s tonight or 55 years down the road
Oh I know there’s so many ways that this could go
Don’t want you to wonder darling I need you to know
 
In this and every life
I choose us every time
 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (x2)
 
We were California Dreamin
Our whole life fit in that car
Didn’t have a bed to sleep in 
We kept each other warm under a ceiling full of stars
 
These days, these nights, are changing
Mama, my mind, is set on you
I'm not afraid to say it, to say I do
 
Oh I hope you know I will carry you home
Whether it’s tonight or 55 years down the road
Oh I know there’s so many ways that this could go
Don’t want you to wonder darling I need you to know
 
In this and every life
I choose us every time
 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (x2)
 
Oh I hope you know I will carry you home
Whether it’s tonight or 55 years down the road

LYRICS

Talk me down
tell me everything’s alright
call me back
say that its all in my mind

Cause i’m running round in circles
trying so hard to convince myself
that you’re asleep alone in your bed
so save me from my misery
i’ll drown in this uncertainty
just tell me that it’s all in my head

I was ready to fall in love with somebody
in love with somebody like you
I was holding on for far too long
cause nothing’s all that I ever knew
I’m still in love with you
with you, without you

Take it back
all the words you said laying in my arms
if you didn’t mean them
cause my heart don’t work like that

Cause i’m running out of reasons
trying so hard to believe in
all the promises you made in the dark
cause when you had me in your orbit
you said only I could solve it
then you left as soon as I fell apart

I was ready to fall in love with somebody
in love with somebody like you
I was holding on for far too long
cause nothing’s all that I ever knew
I’m still in love with you
with you, without you

and you told me to be patient
and I was patient for you
patient for you
and you told me to keep waiting
and I waited for you
only for you

I was ready to fall in love with somebody
in love with somebody like you
I was holding on for far too long
cause nothing’s all that I ever knew

I was ready to fall in love with somebody
in love with somebody like you
I was holding on for far too long
cause nothing’s all that I ever knew
I’m still in love with you
with you, without you
i’m still in love with you

Lyrics: 
There's nothing colder than your shoulder when you're draggin me along like you do
Like you do
And then you switch up with no warning and you kiss me like you want it, how rude
How rude

But I kinda like it anyways
I don't mind if this is gonna take a million days
I know you'll come around
To me eventually
If you sit back, relax, join my company
My company

Once you know what my love's gonna feel like
Nothing else will feel right
You can feel like
Moonbeam ice cream, taking off your blue jeans
Dancing at the movies
'Cause it feels so

Mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know
Once you know
My love is so mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know
Once you know

My little hard-to-get baby
I wanna give you the world
Not saying you gotta chase me
But I wouldn't mind it
If you gave me just a little bit
Of something we can work it with
But all you do is push me out 

But I like it anyways
'Cause I think I'm getting closer to you everyday
I know you'll come around
To me eventually
Just sit back, relax, join my company
Oh, baby, trust me

Once you know what my love's gonna feel like
Nothing else will feel right
You can feel like
Moonbeam ice cream, taking off your blue jeans
Dancing at the movies
'Cause it feels so

Mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know
Once you know
My love is so mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know
Once you know

(Once you know what my love's gonna feel like)
(Moonbeam ice cream, nothing else will feel right)
Mystical, magical
Oh, baby, it's mystical, magical

Lyrics: 
My cold heart 
Is finally melting 
I moved from the 
East to the west wing 
I finally think 
It might be helping 
I confess 
I’m not that versatile 
Say I’m good 
But I might be in denial 
Takes one call 
And that undoes the dial 
  
Baby I tried to 
Call you 
Off like 
A bad habit 
Try to  
Call you 
Off like 
A bad habit 
  
But I keep coming back 
Like a revolving door 
Say I couldn’t want you less 
But I just want you more 
So I keep coming back 
Like a revolving door 
Say I couldn’t want you less 
But I just want you more 
And more 
And more 
And more 
And more 
And more 
And more 
  
Shut it down 
That i try 
Then you come 
Come around 
Fuck me good 
Fuck me up  
Then I gotta move towns 
How’d I get 
From your gym to your couch? 
Oh how?  
  
Baby I tried to 
Call you 
Off like 
A bad habit 
Tried to  
Call you 
Off like 
A bad habit 
  
But I keep coming back 
Like a revolving door 
Say I couldn’t want you less 
But I just want you more 
So I keep coming back 
Like a revolving door 
Say I couldn’t want you less 
But I just want you more 
And more 
And more 
And more 
And more 
And more 
And more 
  
Change my mind so much I can’t find it 
I work so much, can’t be reminded 
Life feels worse but good with you in it 
Supposed to be on stage but fuck it 
I need a minute 
Change my mind so much it’s exhausting 
I still think ’bout that night out in Boston 
I’m more hurt than I would admit 
Supposed to be an adult but fuck it 
I need a minute 
  
I need a minute  
I need a minute 
I need a 
I need a, fuck it 
I need a minute 
 
I need a minute 
I need a minute 
I need a 
I need a, fuck it 
I need a minute 
 
I need a minute, oh 
I need a minute

One life away you can’t explore
But I don’t want to get in the way no more
Cause this the type of feeling you can’t ignore, aye
I’m ready to break down the door
Settle the score
I can’t let you go away
I miss the smile off your face
You know that I lo-lo-lo-love the chase
You told me once that I was crazy
I said “Babygirl I know but I can’t let you go away
So don’t you get me started now
I want a yes, I don’t want maybe’s cause they leave me where you found me
So don’t leave,
Oo, I just love the way you got me feeling
And now I feel it
It’s like Oo
Take away the pain
Baby, I’m healing
Baby, I’m healing
I don’t need anything more
Be the wave, I’ll be the shore
Crashing all over me
I want you
What do you have in store?
Type of girl that make me drop dead on the floor
This the only girl that I love and adore
This the type of love that you can’t ignore
I said hey!
She comin my way
She running round saying whatever she wanna say
I told her I don’t wanna have to do this everyday
Told her that I love her but she thinkin it’s a game
Oh no!
Now she uncomfortable
Never wanna make it the one dimensional oh
Yeah-oh-nanana
Don’t know how we got here don't you get me started now
You told me once that I was crazy
I said “Babygirl I know but I can’t let you go away
So don’t you get me started no
I want a yes, I don’t want maybe’s cause they leave me where you found me
So don’t leave
Oo, I just love the way you got me feeling
Got me feeling it
It’s like Oo
Take away the pain
Baby, I’m healing
Baby, I’m healing
I don’t need anything more
Be the wave, I’ll be the shore
Passion all over me
I want you

Born With a Broken Heart
 
I’ve been tryin’ to change (oooh)
Tryin to find somebody to love me 
Oh Love but I end up in the same damn place again
Hopin I could be different
But I’d be playin’ pretend
 
I wish that I was perfect (just like you)
But I’m an alien
Oh love I’m sending out an sos, take me home
We’re not meant to be together, no
 
What if I said I’m trying
To save your love from dying
Baby I’m too far gone
Don’t wanna see you crying
But I just  know who I am
Maybe that’s the hardest part ohhh
Baby you can’t fix me
I was born with a broken heart 
  
If I was a cactus (ohhh)
You would be a balloon
Oh love
I wanna feel the same as humans do
I wanna feel the same as you, but I don’t
 
What if I said I’m trying
To save your love from dying
Baby I’m too far gone
Don’t wanna see you crying

But I just know who I am
Maybe that’s the hardest part ohhh
Baby you can’t fix me
I was born with a broken heart 
 
 
Ahhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhh
I’m sorry 
That I’m leaving 
Ahhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhh
I’m sorry 
We’re just different
But baby you can’t fix me
 
What if I said I’m trying
To save your love from dying
Baby I’m too far gone
Don’t wanna see you crying
But I just know who I am
Maybe that’s the hardest part ohhh
Baby you can’t fix me
Baby you can’t fix me
Baby you can’t fix me
I was born with a broken heart

Something Beautiful -  Album Out May 30 | Pre-Order Now: https://MileyCyrus.lnk.to/SomethingBeautiful

Text 310-388-5120 

Miley Cyrus unveils “End of the World,” the first official single off of her highly anticipated album, Something Beautiful, out May 30 via Columbia Records. The new single “End of the World” out now.

Lyrics:

Today, you woke up, and you told me that you wanted to cry
The sky was falling like a comet on the fourth of July

Baby you’ve been thinking ’bout the future like it’s already yours
Show me how you’d hold me if tomorrow wasn’t coming for sure
Let’s pretend it’s not the end of the world
Let’s pretend it’s not the end of the world

Let’s spend the dollars you’ve been saving on a Mercedes Benz
And throw a party like McCartney with some help from our friends
Yeah let’s go down to Malibu and watch the sun fade out once more
Show me how you’d hold me if tomorrow was coming for sure
Let’s pretend it’s not the end of the world
Let’s pretend it’s not the end of the world
The sky is falling, falling like a comet now
I can see it coming down
The sky is falling, falling like a comet now

Ooh let’s go to Paris
I don’t care if we get lost in the scene
Paint the city like Picasso would’ve done in his dreams
Do all the things that we were way too terrified of before
I wanna take you to nirvana
We can’t take it too far
Hit the bottom of the bottle and forget who we are
Hold me close, you know tomorrow isn’t coming for sure
Let’s pretend that it’s not the end of the world
Let’s pretend that it’s not the end of the world
Let’s pretend that it’s not the end of the world

Let’s pretend
It’s not the end
Let’s pretend
It’s not the end
Let’s pretend
It’s not the end

Let’s pretend that it’s not the end of the world
The sky is falling, falling like a comet now
Let’s pretend that it’s not the end of the world
The sky is falling, falling like a comet now
Let’s pretend that it’s not the end of the world
The sky is falling, falling like a comet now
I can see it coming down

Lyrics: 
See u so excited 
U got him locked down 
Ur moving like I did 
Before I found out 
He ain’t just a pretty faced talker 
Good with his money 
Close to his mother 
Ur seeing one-sided 
U got him right now 

And she be like he’s so perfect 
I be like oh, what version ?
Ain’t nobody got me this nervous
Oh baby I been there 
And right in that same position 
So baby don’t get this twisted 
No, nothing could make me miss it
Take him he’s yours 

It’s ok I’m ok
Had him in the 1st place 
It’s ok I’m ok 
It’s ok I’m ok 
I don’t rlly gotta say it’s ok 
You can have him anyway 
Anyway 
You can have him anyway 
Anyway

Was such a romantic 
U got me like fuck that 
Some months and some long flights 
Now I can’t go near that  

And she be like he’s so perfect 
I be like oh, what version ?
Ain’t nobody got me this nervous
Oh baby I been there 
And right in that same position 
So baby don’t get this twisted 
No, nothing could make me miss it
Take him he’s yours 

It’s ok I’m ok
Had him in the 1st place 
It’s ok I’m ok 
It’s ok I’m ok 
I don’t rlly gotta say it’s ok 
You can have him anyway 
Anyway
You can have him anyway 
Anyway

I don’t want him anyway, girl take him
I don’t want him anyway, girl take him
I don’t want him anyway, girl take him

Lyrics:
 
Lonely in this crowd I sit alone
Oh
One more drink away from heading home
Oh
 
Oh I can feel the night slipping by
Away from me
And oh, she caught my eye through the light
Then she came right up to me
 
She said oh, hi nice to meet you
Tonight maybe we could
Go dance, get up off our feet
She said this life ain’t forever
One song here together
Then let's play it on repeat
 
We can dance, we can dance all night
We can dance ’til the morning light
Let’s forget about our worries and the wild world outside
She said oh, hi nice to meet you
Tonight maybe we could
Go dance, get up off our feet
We can dance, we can dance all night
 
She took my hand and led me through the dark
Oh
She said feel the beat, forget that broken heart
Oh
 
And oh I can feel the night slipping by
Away from me
And oh, I saw the light in her eyes
Glad she came right up to me
 
She said oh, hi nice to meet you
Tonight maybe we could
Go dance, get up off our feet
She said this life ain’t forever
One song here together
Then let's play it on repeat
 
We can dance, we can dance all night
We can dance ’til the morning light
Let’s forget about our worries and the wild world outside
She said oh, hi nice to meet you
Tonight maybe we could
Go dance, get up off our feet.
We can dance, we can dance all night
 
We can dance, we can dance all night
 
She said oh, hi nice to meet you
Tonight maybe we could
Go dance, get up off our feet
She said this life ain’t forever
One song here together
Then let's play it on repeat
We can dance, we can dance all night

LYRICS

my candy brings all the girls to the yard
And they’re like, should we take one more
see a man might, have to wait at the door 
d*mn right, he a fan right? 
pretty and they

all my b**ches anime they pretty and they f**k
pack em in a Chevrolet and take em to the spot 
c’est la vie, mes ami, 23 and I’m up 
casamigos, something for my ego
in a veto, 20 something people 
please don’t f**k up my libido 
give me sweet talk
tell me, tell me, tell me, 

ahhhhh, you like it when I’m on
my lipstick on your tongue 
just tell me when ur done 

My candy brings all the girls to the yard
And they’re like, should we take one more
see a man might, have to wait at the door 
d*mn right, he a fan right? 

My candy brings all the girls to the yard
And they’re like, should we take one more
see aman might, have to wait at the door 
d*mn right, he a fan right? 

blood spike, ice white, lips lined, looks like 
I might take one, you should play along do the same 
lips locked, it’s hot, it’s not what it looks like 
try a little just for the taste

all these pink pills do these laps round my tongue
easy baby don’t turn me on 
like teasin it don’t you tease

ahhhhh, you like it when I’m on
my lipstick on your tongue 
just tell me when ur done 
just tell me when ur done 

My candy brings all the girls to the yard
And they’re like, should we take one more
see a man might, have to wait at the door 
d*mn right, he a fan right? 

My candy brings all the girls to the yard
And they’re like, should we take one more
see a man might, have to wait at the door 
d*mn right, he a fan right? 

Candy / Girls girls / And they’re like /Candy

Lyrics:
 
People-pleasin' planet
Got a million people sayin' how to plan it
I can no longer stand it
Gonna spend my days tellin' them to can it
Each and to their own
Got a salesman ringin' my phone
Tell me where to go
No, I don't wanna hear the down low

I owe, oh-oh-oh
Nothin', not a penny, never wanna hear you preach
No, oh-oh-oh

(Take-take-take-take) Take me to the beach
Ah-ah-ah, you can have the mountains
Ah-ah-ah, you take the snow
Ah-ah-ah, it's way too cold
My heart is cold enough
Ah-ah-ah, push comes to shove
Ah-ah-ah, you can have the mountains
Ah-ah-ah, I'll take the beach

聞く耳断つ
奴が大層な胸を張る
また構わずやる
「望まない」から舌を打つ
え？
あぁ、神か仏か？ヒト気取りか？
頭の中
Leave me alone
誰になればいいの？
Take your hands off!

I owe, oh-oh-oh
吐き出す前に口をとじろ
No, oh-oh-oh

(Take-take-take-take) Take me to the beach
Ah-ah-ah, you can have the mountains
Ah-ah-ah, you take the snow
Ah-ah-ah, it's way too cold
My heart is cold enough
Ah-ah-ah, push comes to shove
Ah-ah-ah, you can have the mountains
Ah-ah-ah, I'll take the beach

I'm better off alone
Like a rollin' stone
Turnin' off my phone
No one bringin' me down, down, down, down
Just give me some space
That sun in my face
And the days go on, and on, and on, and on (T-A-K-E, T-A-K-E)

T-A-K-E, take me to the beach (Oh)
Ah-ah-ah, you can have the mountains (Have the mountains)
Ah-ah-ah, you take the snow
Ah-ah-ah, it's way too cold (It's way too cold)
My heart is cold enough (Oh)
Ah-ah-ah, push comes to shove
Ah-ah-ah, you can have the mountains
Ah-ah-ah, I'll take the beach (I'll take the)
Take me to the (I'll take the)

I don't have no friends, ask anyone (そう何も)
Got me 'til the end, my favorite one (最後まで)
I don't have no friends, ask anyone (そう誰も)
Got me 'til the end, my favorite one (最後まで)

Lyrics:
I was in a sheer dress
The day that we met 
We were both in a rush 
We talked for a sec 
Your friend hit me up 
So we could connect
And what are the odds 
You send me a text 
And now the next 
Thing I know I’m like 
Manifest
That you’re oversized 
I digress 
Got me scrollin’ like 
Out of breath 
Got me going like 
Oooo ahhhhh 
 
Who’s the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent like 
(Ahhhhh) 
Maybe it’s all in my head 
 
But I bet we’d have really good bed chem 
How you pick me up pull ‘em down turn me round oh it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you’re doing bad things 
That’s bed chem 
How you’re looking at me yea I know what that means and 
I’m obsessed
Are you free next week? 
I’d bet we’d have really good 
 
Come right on me 
I mean camaraderie    
Said you’re not in my time zone but you wanna be 
Where art thou? Why not uponeth me? 
See it my mind let’s fulfill the prophecy 
 
Who’s the cute guy with wide blue eyes and the big bad mmm like 
I know I sound a bit redundant 
 
But I bet we’d have really good bed chem 
How you pick me up pull ‘em down turn me round oh it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you’re doing bad things 
That’s bed chem 
How you’re looking at me yeah I know what that means and 
I’m obsessed
Are you free next week? 
I’d bet we’d have really good 
Bed chem 
 
And I bet we’d both arrive at the same time 
And I bet the thermostats set at six nine 
And I bet it’s even better than in my head 


How you pick me up pull ‘em down turn me round oh it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you’re doing bad things 
That’s bed chem 
How you’re looking at me yeah I know what that means and 
I’m obsessed
Are you free next week? 
I’d bet we’d have really good

Lyrics:
Oh, hey
I'm so mature, collected and sensible
Except when I get hit with rejection
To turn me down
Well, that's just unethical
I'll turn into someone you're scared to know

But if you need my love
My clothes are off
I'm coming over to your place
And if you don't need (if you don't need) my love
Well, I didn't want your little bitch-ass anyway
Yeah, I'm a busy woman
I wouldn't let you come into my calendar any night
But if you want my kisses
I'll be your perfect Mrs.
'Til the day that one of us dies

Oh, hey
Busy woman, all the time
Busy woman
So much to shave and lipstick to reapply
Maybe for you, though, I could accommodate
I'm flexible
So just tell me what you like
Tantric yoga baby
Namaste
If you don't want me
I'll just deem you gay

But if you need my love
My clothes are off
I'm coming over to your place
And if you don't need (if you don't need) my love
Well, I didn't want your little bitch-ass anyway
Yeah, I'm a busy woman
I wouldn't let you come into my calendar any night
But if you want my kisses
I'll be your perfect Mrs.
'Til the day that one of us dies
Busy woman
All the time
Busy woman
For the rest of my life
My openings are super tight
Busy woman
Unless you call tonight
Night, ooh

But if you need my love
My clothes are off
I'm coming over to your place
And if you don't need (if you don't need) my love
Well, I didn't want your little bitch-ass anyway
Cuz I'm a busy woman
I wouldn't let you come into my calendar any night
But if you want my kisses
I'll be your perfect Mrs.
'Til the day that one of us dies

Lyrics:
My boy’s a winner
He loves the game
My lips reflect off his cross-gold chain
I like the way
He’s telling me
My ass looks good in these ripped blue jeans
My cheeks are red like cherries in the spring
Body’s a work of art you’d die to see
 
Untouched
XO
Young lust
Let’s
 
When we drive in your car
I’m your baby (so sweet)
Losing all my innocence in the backseat
Say you love say you love
Say you love me (love me)
Losing all my innocence in the backseat
 
When we drive in your car
I’m your baby (so sweet)
Losing all my innocence in the backseat
Say you love say you love
Say you love me (love me)
Losing all my innocence in the backseat
 
Break all the rules till we get caught
Fog up the windows in the parking lot
Summer love
Sexy
Sittin’ on his lap sippin’ diet pepsi
 
I write my name with lipstick on your chest
I leave a mark so you know I’m the best
 
Untouched
XO
Young lust
Let’s go
 
When we drive in your car
I’m your baby (so sweet)

When we drive in your car
I’m your baby (so sweet)
Losing all my innocence in the backseat
Say you love say you love
Say you love me (love me)

When we, baby

Lyrics:
Don’t have to tell your hot ass a thing 
Oh yeah you just get it 
Whole package babe I like the way you fit 
God bless your dad’s genetics
 
You make me wanna make you fall in love 
Oh late at night I’m thinking ‘bout you (ah ah ah) 
Wanna try out my fuzzy pink hand cuffs? 
Oh 
I hear you knockin’ baby 
Come on up
 
I know you want my touch for life 
If you love me right then who knows 
I might let you make me juno
You know I just  
Might let you lock me down tonight 
One of me is cute but two though? 
Give it to me baby 
You make me wanna make you fall in love
 
I showed my friends 
Then we high fived 
Sorry if you feel objectified 
Can’t help my self
Hormones are high 
Give me more than just some butterflies
 
You make me wanna make you fall in love 
Oh late at night I’m thinking ‘bout you (ah ah ah) 
Wanna try out some freaky positions? 
Have you ever tried this one?

I know you want my touch for life 
If you love me right then who knows 
I might let you make me juno
You know I just  
Might let you lock me down tonight 
One of me is cute but two though
Give it to me baby 
You make me wanna make you fall in love

Adore me 
Hold me and explore me 
Mark your territory 
Tell me I’m the only only only only one 
Adore me
Hold me and explore me 
I’m so fucking horny 
Tell me I’m the only only only only one 

I know you want my touch for life 
If you love me right then who knows 
I might let you make me juno
You know I just  
Might let you lock me down tonight 
One of me is cute but two though
Give it to me baby 
You make me wanna make you fall in love

LYRICS:
I don’t go out but I’ll do it for you
You never liked it when I drink too much
I hate to dance but I’ll dance for you
Cus I’d do anything to feel your touch
Don’t like anybody tell me why it’s different with you
Don’t believe in love but no one makes me feel like you do
I don’t say it much cus I just always thought that you knew
It’s what you do to me
I’m wrapped around your finger and I can’t stop
You know I got a soft spot for you
You know I got a soft spot for you
Baby can’t you see
I need you cus you’re everything that I’m not
You know I got a soft spot for you
You know I got a soft spot for you
Too late
Don’t wanna fall baby I just
Don’t need somebody else to throw me aside
But I’m up all night
Thinking bout how it could be you to
Change my heart but I
Don’t like anybody tell me why it’s different with you
Don’t believe in love but no one makes me feel like you do
I don’t say it much cus I just always thought that you knew
It’s what you do to me
I’m wrapped around your finger and I can’t stop
You know I got a soft spot for you
You know I got a soft spot for you
Baby can’t you see
I need you cus you’re everything that I’m not
You know I got a soft spot for you
You know I got a soft spot for you
For you
For you, for you
For you
You know I got a soft spot for you
It’s what you do to me
I’m wrapped around your finger and I can’t stop
You know I got a soft spot for you
You know I got a soft spot for you

Lyrics: 
 
You’re my cherry pie
I don’t care who knows it
Love me till I die
Bury me with roses

I know you’re awfully shy
But I can’t wait to hold it to hold that
Your big big hard heart!

With Open arms
Holding you naked
Middle of sunset
Boulevard
Making you famous
Everyone’s watching
Bare skin concrete
Their calling the police
Open arms
Holding you naked
Middle of sunset

Feels so good it hurts
But u fill up what’s broken
Women of few words
But for you I keep my mouth wide open
Praying and hoping
That ya quench my thirst
Not just dip your toes in
I want that
Big, big, hard heart!

With open arms
Holding you naked
Middle of sunset
Boulevard
Making you famous
Everyone’s watching
Bare skin concrete
Their calling the police
Open arms
Holding you naked
Middle of sunset

I just wanna touch it touch it
Try your hardest not to bust it
Gimme gimme love it love it
Hey hey hey

I just wanna touch it touch it
Try your hardest not to bust it
Gimme gimme how I love ur
Big big heart

With open arms
Holding you naked
Middle of sunset
Boulevard
Making you famous
Everyone’s watching
Bare skin concrete
Their calling the police
Open arms
Holding you naked
Middle of sunset

FCG Heem - Miami (Official Music Video)","HoodTrophy Bino and FCG Heem drop Miami.  From Bino, “’Miami’ was a bridge for me from LA to the South sound.  The song is about seeing life in a different way – peaceful moments, no cares, feels like a vacation.  Also the ocean is different, it brings calm.”

Lyrics: 

I sip it in the way he likes 
Ruby red
Locking eyes
Lipstick kisses with no ice 
On the edge
Paradise

You walked in, big ass grin
Talking like we’re friends, honey what were you thinking 
He loves me, I love him
Look at you
Just look at you now

You're so embarrassing
Go cry where no one’s watching 
I can’t imagine it
How does it feel to be forgotten? 
Forgotten (ah)
Forgotten (ah)
How does it feel?
I hope one day you heal
How does it feel to be forgotten? 
Forgotten

I know it must be difficult
I know it isn’t what you thought

Cause walked in, big ass grin
Talking like the friend’s honey what were you thinking? 
He loves me, I love him
Look at you
Just look at you now

You’re so embarrassing
Go cry when no one’s watching 
I can’t imagine it
How does it feel to be forgotten? 
Forgotten (ah)
Forgotten (ah)

How does it feel?
I hope one day you heal
How does it feel to be forgotten? 
Forgotten

Ahora todo está dicho y hecho
Todo está olvidado

-English Translation: 
Now, everything is said and done. 
Everything is forgotten
